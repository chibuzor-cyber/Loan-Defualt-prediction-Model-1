# Loan-Defualt-prediction-Model-1
The Loan Default Prediction Model is a machine-learning system designed to predict whether an applicant is likely to default on a loan (or whether a loan should be approved or not). Using historical loan application data, the model learns patterns that distinguish approved applicants from those who are likely to default.
